About me
---

I am a PhD student at Oregon State University's Marine Mammal Institute. My research interests are in the ecology and conservation of marine mammals, utilizing tools such as spatial ecology and distribution modeling, bioacoustics, and oceanography. The focus of my doctoral research is on the ecology of blue whales in New Zealand.
